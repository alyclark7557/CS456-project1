# CS456-project1
Chase Myers and Aly Clark

Workplan:

Goal: We would like to be done with the coding aspect of this project by Monday morning (2/21/22)

Rough Outline of Schedule:

2/17/22: Brainstorm problem 1. Communication will be done asynchronously through text for this part due to conflicting schedules. Aly will finish coding this problem on her own, and Chase will review it when she is done. Once code has been reviewed, both parties will write the analysis. Aly will write the explanation of the code, the computation for the number of instructions, and the implementation of a critical section. Chase will write a computation of CPU time as well as discuss the power consumption.
2/18/22: Brainstorm problem 2. Communication will be done both synchronously and asynchronously through texting and working on a google doc at the same time. Meeting will be at approximately 3 pm and occur over google docs; facetime may be utilized if confusion arises. Chase will finish coding this problem on her own, and Aly will review it when he is done. Once code has been reviewed, both parties will write the analysis. Chase will write the explanation of the code, the computation for the number of instructions, and the implementation of a critical section. Aly will write a computation of CPU time as well as discuss the power consumption.
2/20/22: Brainstorm problem 3. Communication will be done asynchronously through text and updating a mutual google doc on the individual's own time. Aly will finish coding this problem on her own, and Chase will review it when she is done. Once code has been reviewed, both parties will write the analysis. Aly will write the explanation of the code, the computation for the number of instructions, and the implementation of a critical section. Chase will write a computation of CPU time as well as discuss the power consumption.

Also on 2/20/22: At 7pm, there will be a synchronous meeting over Facetime to go over the whole analysis and code one more time. Everything will be finalized and turned in by Monday morning (2/21/22).

Primary Communication Mediums: Texting, Facetime, Google Docs, in Person (as needed due to busy schedules)
